> #### HCI Researcher : Barış SERIM

Barış is a an HCI researcher with a PhD. from Aalto University. His research is about using visual attention information for human-computer interaction and models of mind in HCI.

Here is an exemple of one of his recent publication, which deal about Revisiting embodiment for brain–computer
interfaces

The article "Revisiting embodiment for brain–computer interfaces" examines the question of embodiment in the context of brain–computer interfaces (BCI), highlighting the tension between the use of BCI, which minimizes bodily participation, and the embodied view of cognition. Authors Serim, Spapé and Jacucci posit that although BCIs are often seen as directly accessing mental states, the role of the body in interacting with the technology remains crucial.

The article begins by discussing research on direct access to mental states via BCIs, which promise simplified communication and more intuitive control of devices. However, human-computer interaction (HCI) research generally values ​​tangible interfaces and bodily gestures, which creates a tension between traditional and BCI-based views. Despite the growing interest in BCIs in non-medical applications, the authors emphasize that embodiment must be considered in evaluating the effectiveness and acceptance of these interfaces.

The second part explores the relationship between cognition and the body, questioning the model of cognition disconnected from bodily activity. The authors argue that cognition is rooted in sensorimotor processes and internal representations of the body, impacting the performance of BCIs based on motor imagery. Studies show that mental imagery activates circuits similar to those engaged in physical task execution, suggesting that bodily experience enhances BCI use.

Several lines of research are proposed to understand how bodily aspects influence BCI performance. This includes the study of motor variables and their impact, the integration of tangible devices to reinforce motor imagery, and the analysis of qualitative differences in language production via BCIs.

In conclusion, the authors call for an integrated approach that considers the role of the body even in contexts where movement is limited. The goal is to promote BCI development that combines embodied cognition and optimized interaction, thereby expanding the frontiers of research in human-computer interaction and BCI technology.

> #### The Ultimate Display

Ivan Sutherland, known as a founding figure in HCI and an Internet pioneer, was awarded the Turing Prize for creating SketchPad, the precursor to modern CAD software. In his essay The Ultimate Display, he explores the ultimate goal of display technologies and reviews the state of the art at that time.

Sutherland discusses three main topics:

* Computer displays as windows: He describes how computer displays can act as windows into mathematical and physical worlds beyond human sensory perception, allowing visualization of concepts like negative masses, non-projective transformations, and constraints.

* Types and functions of displays: Sutherland examines different types of displays, including visual, audio, kinesthetic, and force feedback displays, and their ability to create and manipulate virtual objects that break the conventional rules of reality. He also explains the role of various input devices such as keyboards, light pens, joysticks, and eye trackers in interacting with the computer and its displayed objects.

* The ultimate display as a wonderland: He envisions the ultimate display as a room where the computer could control the existence of matter itself, creating a wonderland for human exploration and learning. Such a display would allow people to gain familiarity with concepts that have no visual representation in the physical world.

> #### Meta Quest Pro : A failed innovation 

An example of failed innovation in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) is the Meta Quest Pro headset, often associated with Meta (formerly Facebook)'s ambitions to create a "metaverse". Although heralded as a major step forward in the immersive experience, the headset failed to achieve significant commercial success.

* High cost: One of the main obstacles to the success of the Meta Quest Pro was its high price. Positioned at a price point of several hundred dollars or more, it was inaccessible to most consumers, thus limiting its reach.

* Lack of compelling applications: Despite the promise of the metaverse, there was a lack of an ecosystem of applications and content that would justify such an investment. Users did not find enough added value in the daily use of the device.

* Limited user experience: Although the technology was advanced, the user experience was not intuitive or revolutionary enough to convince users to change their habits and adopt this new technology.

To succeed in the AR/VR space, it is essential to make devices more affordable and accessible, with simplified versions. An ecosystem rich in useful and attractive applications must be developed to offer immediate benefits. The user experience must be improved to ensure comfort and fluidity, while avoiding fatigue. The technology must be introduced gradually through familiar platforms like smartphones. Finally, awareness campaigns must show concrete and practical uses to encourage social acceptance.
