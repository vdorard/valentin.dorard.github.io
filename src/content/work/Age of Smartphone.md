> #### The Shape of the Future Smartphone

The emergence of mobile phones has transformed human communication and interaction, ushering in an era of rapid technological growth that has consistently pushed the limits of innovation. Looking back on this evolution, it’s remarkable how quickly we have advanced to the smartphone era. This article explores the journey from early mobile phones to modern smartphones, with a particular focus on the changes in their shape. It also delves into potential future developments in smartphone design, along with likely reasons for these trends.

In the early 1970s, mobile phones were largely characterized by bulky car-mounted devices. The "brick" phones of the 1980s, so named for their large and heavy form factor, followed shortly after. These phones offered basic communication capabilities and were symbols of status and privilege. However, it was in the 1990s that a major shift occurred with the rise of flip phones and slider phones, driven in part by pop culture and media influences. This shift met the growing consumer demand for more compact, portable devices.

The move towards sleek, user-friendly smartphones has been driven by technological advancements and changing consumer expectations, especially in the 21st century. These factors have shaped smartphones to prioritize aesthetics, usability, and portability.

>#### What Lies Ahead for Smartphones?

Looking forward, advancements in flexible display technologies, miniaturization, and wireless communication could have a significant impact on smartphone design. With companies like Samsung and Huawei already leading the way with foldable smartphones, there is little doubt that flexible displays are a key part of the future. Such flexibility may eventually lead to fully foldable or rollable smartphones, providing larger screens without sacrificing portability.

>#### Conclusion

The evolution of mobile phones into advanced smartphones has been heavily influenced by technological progress and consumer demands. Changes in smartphone shape, in particular, have aimed to enhance functionality, aesthetics, and portability. As technology continues to break new ground, we can expect smartphones to adopt more flexible, compact forms, with foldable, rollable, and even wearable designs moving from science fiction to everyday reality. Ultimately, the future of smartphones will depend on balancing practical design considerations, user needs, and innovative technology.

> #### The Computer of the 21st Century by Mark Weiser

In his 1991 essay published in *Scientific American¹*, Mark Weiser presented his vision of a world where computing is ubiquitous—seamlessly integrated into our environment in a natural, almost invisible way. He provided examples of technologies to realize this vision, such as tablets, wall-mounted screens, electronic badges, and wireless sensors. Weiser also explored the social and ethical challenges posed by this pervasive form of computing, including issues of privacy, security, responsibility, and cultural diversity.

Today, we live in a world that partially aligns with Weiser’s vision, using connected devices daily that deliver information or services almost automatically. Our smartphones, smartwatches, voice assistants, thermostats, cars, and even refrigerators communicate with each other and the internet to simplify our lives. We can access personal data, contacts, schedules, entertainment, and news from virtually anywhere at any time.

However, there are still challenges to overcome before we can fully realize Weiser’s vision of harmonious, user-centered ubiquitous computing. These include:

- **Standardization and interoperability**: Ensuring consistent communication protocols and formats across devices and platforms.
- **Reliability and resilience**: Developing systems that can handle breakdowns, errors, or malicious attacks.
- **Data protection and privacy**: Safeguarding personal data against risks like surveillance, theft, or manipulation.
- **Intuitive human-machine interfaces**: Designing user interfaces that are ergonomic, context-sensitive, and easy to use.
- **User-centric design**: Taking into account user needs, preferences, and values in technology development and deployment.
- **User awareness and education**: Informing and training users on the benefits and limitations of ubiquitous computing.
- **Legal and social regulation**: Addressing the legal, economic, and social implications of pervasive technology.

>#### Conclusion

Weiser’s essay encourages us to reflect on the role and impact of computing in society. He shows that ubiquitous computing is not merely a technical evolution but a cultural transformation requiring a multidisciplinary, participatory approach. Weiser reminds us that computing should serve humanity, not dominate it.

>#### Killer Apps for Head-Mounted Displays (HMD)

Here are some applications that could help widely popularize Head-Mounted Displays:

- **Hologram Calling App**: A spatial calling app could be a game-changer for AR/VR. This would involve detailed 3D scans of the caller's face or body, allowing their hologram to appear in front of you during a call. The 3D model would mimic real-time facial and body movements, making conversations feel more natural. This could be especially useful for corporate meetings.

- **Advanced Computer Vision Apps**: Harnessing computer vision for scene and object recognition could bring tremendous value to everyday life. These applications could assist with tasks like cooking or driving and even support technical jobs like car repairs or industrial maintenance.

- **Interconnected Experiences in the Metaverse**: Similar to *Ready Player One*, a seamless metaverse where users can move through various digital worlds with rich visuals and interactions would likely attract more people to HMDs. This metaverse could offer spaces for entertainment, socializing, work, and education.

These applications represent what AR/VR technology should aim to achieve. While some of these ideas are closer to reality than others, they show how future advancements might shape the technology in unexpected ways.
