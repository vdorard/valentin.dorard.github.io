> #### Sketching ideas

<strong>Alert about danger using AR tool</strong>

The idea is that as humans we cannot check if danger is present 360° around us. So, I imagined a headset AR device, that check 180° each, which can trigger a warning when a danger is close to us. The device can calculate de trajectory of each element around us, and see if something dangerous is coming nearby. 

<strong>Trajectory calculation</strong>

This time, I thought about a lens that may be useful to our golf players, I was thinking about A VR device that calculates the trajectory and position the golfer must use to put the ball in the hole. This can help people to see if they are aligned with the hole and correct their positions. 

<strong>AR Games</strong>

This is a simple idea but I think that it can be cool, I don't know how many played the card game 'Yu-Gi-Oh', but when i was young, i was playing it and imagined that i was in the cartoon. The idea is simple, recreate with a lens the scene from the anime, and doing animation.

> #### Prototype 

So this could be the headphone device : a simple headphone, with a camera inside that can scan and detect objects, preventing the users from danger with an alert if it comes to close.

> #### Feedback

After asking my dad about that, he thinks it can be a cool stuff for young people that don't always check corners, but the cost may be too high to be afford by everyone.
