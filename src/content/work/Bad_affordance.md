## Principles of Good Design

1. **Affordance** – Understanding how users interact with objects based on visual and functional cues.
2. **Gestalt's Laws** – Grouping and pattern recognition to simplify user interaction.
3. **Dark Designs** – Ethical considerations in avoiding manipulative design patterns.

### Introduction

Good design determines how a user interacts with a system and how the system responds to user actions.

A successful design is intuitive and easy to use.

The role of the designer is to ensure that the user easily understands how to use the system and that the system responds in a predictable way for the user.

**In this article, I will go over different types of design, and present either good or bad example of each one.**

### Affordance

Affordance is the technique that makes the user intuitively guess how to use the object.

Let's take an example of a good design affordance : 

![Button for a good affordance](/assets/good_affordance.jpeg)

Each of those buttons are intuitive to use. 

The first one is a press button, and the drawing on it make it explicit for the users. The second one is clearly a flip and switch, and the third one is a rotate button. 

By the design, the lack of other possibilites than the rights one. The use of those button are intuitive and very clear. This is what a good affodance should look like. 

#### Good affordance

The rice cooker is an example of good affodance. The rice cooker is equipped with a push-button for cooking and two lights labeled “cook” and “warm”. When rice and water are put into the rice cooker, the button is pressed, the "cook" light is up, and when the rice is hot, the button is automatically changed and make a sound, and the "warm" is lights up.

#### Bad affordance

In this design, i can't figure out which way should I put the key on my laptop, I have this impression that the first one is wrong, so I try the other way. This could be fix if both size could fit, as USB-C does.

#### Gestalt's Laws of perception

Gestalt laws are a set of principles that explain how the human brain interprets visual elements. They claim that factors such as color, shape, size, proximity and orientation influence our perception of these elements. There are composed with six laws which are as follows :

![Gestalt's laws](/assets/Gestalt.png)


- **Law of Proximity** : Elements that are close to each other are perceived as a group.
- **Law of Similarity** : Elements that are similar to each other are perceived as a group.
- **Law of Closure**: The brain tends to fill in the gaps of incomplete shapes.
- **Law of Continuity** : The brain tends to perceive continuous lines rather than discontinuous ones.
- **Law of Common Region** : Elements that are in the same region are perceived as a group.
- **Law of Prägnanz (or Law of Good Figure)** : The brain tends to perceive simple shapes rather than complex ones.

##### Bad implementation of Gestalt's laws

The carrefour's logo was a mystery for me for a very long time, at first, i was seeing a face turned 90°, but in face, it's a C in diamond. What could be achieve to make it clearer, is highlight the C, with a black pen.

Also, a example of a design I saw recently that was made by a worker, is the design of the paint with the label "STOP" which is here "SOTP". I think we all know what he should have done..

#### Dark design 

There are a lot of dark design patterns, which are intentionally deceptive design techniques used to manipulate users into taking unwanted or unbeneficial actions. Here are several examples of it : 

- **Confirmshaming** : When an application makes you culpabilize to not using it, for example in duolingo : 

In order to counter that, The choices offered to users must be neutral and respectful. For example, the options should simply say "Yes, I want to subscribe" and "No, thank you" without implicit judgment.

![Carrefour logo](/assets/confirmshaming.jpg)

- **Roach Motel** : The aspect of make the subscribing so much easier than the unsubscribing. In a lot of application like Capcut, there are a lot of steps to unsubscibe the service. Even in some business in real life, such as sports hall, this mechanism is used to keep the client in the service.

Options to opt-in and opt-out should be equally accessible and easy to find, so users have fair control over their decisions.
